# node-red-contrib-yeelight-compat-hue

[Node-RED](http://nodered.org) nodes to control [MiHome/Xiaomi Yeelights](https://www.yeelight.com/) from your smart home, somewhat [API compatible with node-red-contrib-node-hue nodes](https://github.com/jdomeij/node-red-contrib-node-hue#input-node).


## Install

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory – typically `~/.node-red`:

```bash
npm i node-red-contrib-yeelight-compat-hue -S
```

## Usage

Provides two palette nodes – one to send control commands to a Yeelight, and one to receive messages when a Yeelight's state changes.

![](https://github.com/mattmattmatt/node-red-contrib-yeelight-compat-hue/blob/master/tooling/nodes.png?raw=true)


### Output node

Sets the state of the selected Yeelight device.

`msg.payload` must be an object containing the new state's properties of the selected Yeelight device.

| Property | Details |
| :---| :---|
| `on`   | Sets the `on` state where the value is `true`, `false`, `toggle`, `moon` or `daylight` |
| `bri`   | Sets the brightness value from `0` to `255` |
| `ct`   | Sets the color temperature value in Kelvin from `1700` to `6500` |
| `hue` | Sets the hue value from `0` to `65535` |
| `sat`  | Sets the saturation value from `0` to `255`  |
| `hex`  | Sets the rgb value from `#00000` to `#FFFFFF`   |
| `duration` | Sets a transition time in milliseconds, e.g. `4500` means 4.5 seconds. Defaults to `500` |

#### Example payloads

```JSON
 {
    "on": true,
    "bri": 255,
    "hue": 913,
    "sat": 255,
    "duration": 5000
}
```
```JSON
{
    "on": true,
    "bri": 120,
    "hex": "#AA00CC",
}
```
```JSON
{
    "ct": 2200,
}
```
The node supports sending [color temperature values](http://www.erco.com/service/rgbw/), [hex values](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/) and [HSV values](https://alloyui.com/examples/color-picker/hsv).  
The brightness value will always have to be provided separately and will not be deducted from e.g. a hex value's brightness component.

##### References
This node's input payload structure is based on [node-red-contrib-node-hue](https://github.com/jdomeij/node-red-contrib-node-hue#input-node), which is based on [Node Hue API](https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api#lightstate-options).


### Input node

Returns the current state of the selected Yeelight device.

`msg.payload` is an object containing the current state of the selected Yeelight device.

The node will listen to changes of the connected Yeelight and send a message whenever a change is detected. The `payload` property of the message will be set to the new state of the Yeelight.

Additionally, a fresh state can be requested from the connected Yeelight by sending a message to the node. The `payload` property of the message will be overwritten with the state of the Yeelight. All other properties of the `msg` are preserved.

#### Example payload
```JSON
{
    "state": {
        "on": false,
        "bri": 255,
        "colormode": "rgb",
        "hex": "#ff1500",
        "hue": 913,
        "sat": 255
    },
    "name": "Closet",
    "raw": {
        "name": "Closet",
        "power": "off",
        "bright": "100",
        "rgb": "16717056",
        "ct": "4244",
        "hue": "0",
        "sat": "100",
        "color_mode": "1",
        "delayoff": "0",
        "flowing": "0",
        "flow_params": "0,1,10000,1,16711680,69,33000,1,16711882,34,39000,1,16744704,17,34000,1,16711680,61",
        "music_on": "0"
    }
}
```

The `raw` property of `msg.payload` contains the raw state information retrieved from the Yeelight for advanced usage.  
Note that value scales are not compatible with _node-red-contrib-node-hue_, and that `hue` value and `rgb` value will not match since only the correct color per `color_mode` is returned by the lamp.


### Configuration node

Configures a Yeelight connection to one light in the local network.

#### Options

| Property | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hostname | An IP address or other hostname that points to a Yeelight on the network |
| Port number | Port number the Yeelight is accessible over, default being `55443` |

#### Details
**Developer mode/LAN control** has to be activated (usually from within the Yeelight app) to allow local control of the Yeelight through Node-RED. You can <a href="https://www.yeelight.com/en_US/developer" target="_blank">learn more about Yeelight developer options</a> here.

## Support
